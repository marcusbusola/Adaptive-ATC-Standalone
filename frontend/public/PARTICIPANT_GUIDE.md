# Participant Task Guide: How to Play

Welcome! You're about to become an Air Traffic Controller (ATC). Don't worry - we'll walk you through everything you need to know.

---

## Your Goal

**Keep aircraft safe.** Guide planes to their destinations without them getting too close to each other.

**The Safety Rule:** Aircraft must stay separated by:
- **3 miles** horizontally (side to side)
- **1,000 feet** vertically (up and down)

---

## The Screen

### Radar Display (Center)
The big black screen with green dots and triangles. This is your radar showing all the aircraft in your airspace.

Each aircraft shows:
```
AAL119        ← Aircraft name (callsign)
310 450       ← Altitude (310 = 31,000 ft) and Speed (450 knots)
```

**Color meanings:**
- **Green** = Normal, everything's fine
- **Yellow/Orange** = Emergency declared
- **Gray** = Communication lost (can't reach the pilot)

### Action Panel (Right Side)
This is your control center. Here you can:
- **Select aircraft** to view details and available actions
- **Check Status / Inspect** - actively monitor a selected aircraft
- **Resolve needs** - address maintenance or pilot requests
- **Issue commands** - change altitude, heading, or speed
- **See expected actions** - a checklist of what needs attention
- **View action history** - your recent commands

### Status Bar
Shows how many aircraft you're managing, any active conflicts, and elapsed time.

## Your Three Jobs

### 1. Keep Scanning
Don't stare at just one plane! Constantly look around the whole radar.
- Are any paths crossing?
- Is anyone changing color (new emergency)?
- Are two planes getting close?

### 2. Take Action
When something needs your attention:
1. **Select the aircraft** by clicking its button in the Action Panel
2. **Click an action button** to issue a command

Actions might include:
- Changing an aircraft's heading (direction)
- Changing altitude (climb or descend)
- Granting clearances
- Issuing advisories

*Note: You don't type commands - just click the buttons provided.*

## Your Safety Score

You start with a **Safety Score of 100**. Your goal is to keep it at **90 or above**.

**What lowers your score:**
- Having aircraft too close together (conflicts)
- Leaving emergencies unresolved
- Making pilots wait too long (they get frustrated → angry)
- Ignoring maintenance needs

**What raises your score:**
- Keeping all aircraft safely separated
- Resolving emergencies quickly
- Keeping pilots satisfied

The score updates in real-time on your status bar.

### 3. Handle Alerts
The system will show you alerts when something needs attention.

**Important:**
- Alerts may appear in different ways during this study
- Some alerts need you to click "Acknowledge" before you can continue
- Some alerts show suggestions you can accept or dismiss
- **Read each alert carefully and respond as quickly as you can**
- Your response time is being measured

## Quick Reference

| You see this... | Do this... |
|-----------------|------------|
| Two planes getting close | Select one, click a Turn or Altitude action |
| Yellow/orange aircraft | Look for emergency actions in the Action Panel |
| Gray aircraft | Look for communication recovery actions |
| An alert pops up | Read it and respond (acknowledge, accept, or dismiss) |
| Screen feels overwhelming | Stay calm - handle the closest conflicts first |

## How You're Scored

We're measuring:
- **Safety** - Did you keep aircraft properly separated?
- **Response time** - How quickly did you handle alerts and situations?
- **Awareness** - Did you monitor the whole airspace, not just one area?

---

## Tips for Success

1. **Keep your eyes moving** - Scan the entire radar regularly
2. **Don't tunnel vision** - If you're focused on one problem, glance around for others
3. **Check the Action Panel** - It shows you what actions are expected
4. **Respond to alerts quickly** - But read them first!
5. **Stay calm** - Even when it gets busy, you've got this

## Ready?

Take a breath. Watch the radar. Keep those planes safe.

Good luck, Controller!
